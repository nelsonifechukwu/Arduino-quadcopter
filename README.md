# Arduino-quadcopter
A fully functional quadcopter with the Arduino Microcontroller, Electronics and C programming Language

This code here is derived from Joop Brokking (http://www.brokking.net/)

I made a few tweaks to fly to build and fly to my taste.

Well, Joop's Explanations were great, but a little technical for me. I had to rewatch a ton of times.
